# 🧠 Yuno – Product Vision

**Version:** 1.0

## 🎯 What is Yuno?

Yuno is **the internet’s first Proof of Mind layer** — a next-gen human verification system that replaces frustrating CAPTCHAs with micro-challenges designed to verify humanness, delight users, and generate high-quality data for training ethical, intelligent AI.

Yuno turns every bot check into a moment of meaning — a fast, fun, cognitively engaging interaction that transforms digital friction into fuel for the future of artificial intelligence.

## 🌍 Why Yuno Exists

Modern CAPTCHAs are broken:  
- They annoy humans.  
- They barely stop bots.  
- They waste billions of daily interactions.

At the same time, AI is starving for high-quality, human-labeled data — especially around **reasoning**, **emotion**, **ethics**, and **cultural nuance**.

Yuno solves both problems.

It introduces a new internet primitive: **Proof of Mind** — where proving you're human means producing micro-evidence of real thinking.

## 🧩 What Makes Yuno Unique

### ✅ Challenge-as-Verification:
Instead of traffic lights or distorted text, users engage in 5–10 second mini-games that test real human abilities:
- Sarcasm detection  
- Cultural decoding  
- Visual illusions  
- Moral reasoning  
- Creative prompts

Each one verifies the user **and** contributes to AI training.

---

### 📡 A Dual Data Stream:

Every interaction generates structured signal data:
- **Human Stream** → Fuels the next generation of LLMs and multimodal AI.
- **Bot Stream** → Feeds detection models to adapt and evolve challenges in real time.

---

### 🤖 Humanizing AI at Internet Scale

Each Yuno challenge produces one high-value data point grounded in *human cognition*.  
Multiplied across the web, this becomes a continuous, crowdsourced stream of:
- Emotional tone labeling  
- Social intelligence  
- Creative interpretation  
- Contextual logic  
- Voice/avatar data (via Tavus)

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building

Yuno is both a **widget** and a **platform**:

- **Frontend Widget:** Lightweight, embeddable JS & React component.
- **Challenge Engine:** Runs on Bolt.new (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui).
- **Database & Logic:** Supabase with secure row-level access.
- **Voice/Avatar Challenge:** Integrated with Tavus for real-time video prompts.
- **AI Content Generation:** Powered by OpenAI APIs to keep challenges novel and relevant.

---

## 💡 Long-Term Vision

Yuno becomes the **invisible thinking layer** of the internet — quietly verifying humanity, training AI, and understanding bot evolution through playful, intentional micro-interactions.

### We envision:
- A world where **users enjoy CAPTCHAs**  
- A new class of **data-driven AI training games**  
- A **decentralized proof-of-mind layer** integrated across the web  
- A **safer, more human internet** powered by trust, not annoyance

## 🏁 Our Promise

**To developers:** Integration is easy. Performance is fast. Data is structured and useful.  
**To users:** It’s not just a checkpoint — it’s a microgame that matters.  
**To the future:** Every challenge you complete helps teach the next generation of AI how to reason, empathize, and align with human values.

> **Yuno isn't just security. It's a cognitive handshake between humans and machines.**
